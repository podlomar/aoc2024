# Advent of Code 2024

My attempts at the Advent of Code 2024 challenges in Deno and TypeScript.

## Usage

To run the code for a specific day, use the following command:

```sh
cd dayXX
deno run -R partX.ts your_input.txt
```

Where `XX` is the day you want to run and `X` is the part of the challenge you want to run.

## Code of Conduct

1. I am trying to keep the code as clean and modular as possible so that it is easy to read and understand for anyone who wants to look at it and maybe learn something from it.
1. I am not trying to be the cleverest person in the universe and make the code as short as possible by using super involved smart-ass one-liners. Mostly because I am not that smart anyway. But also I want the code to be friendly to visitors or beginners who maybe want to learn something.
