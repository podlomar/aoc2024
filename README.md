# Advent of Code 2024

My attempts at the Advent of Code 2024 challenges in Deno and TypeScript.

## Usage

To run the code for a specific day, use the following command:

```sh
cd dayXX
deno run -R partX.ts your_input.txt
```

Where `XX` is the day you want to run and `X` is the part of the challenge you want to run.

## Code Structure

I am trying to keep the code as clean and modular as possible so that it is easy to read and understand for anyone who wants to look at it and maybe learn something from it.
